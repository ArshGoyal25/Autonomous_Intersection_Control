**Autonomous Intersection Control**

This project aimed to develop a realistic and interactive traffic simulation framework to address real-world traffic challenges. The system models vehicle dynamics, roads, intersections, and traffic signals, making it a powerful tool for city traffic planning and autonomous vehicle testing.  

**Key Features:**  
1. **Traffic Simulation:**  
  - Creation of roads and intersections for various traffic scenarios.  
  - Management of vehicle movement and traffic density under dynamic conditions.  

2. **Vehicle Behavior:**  
  - Realistic modeling of acceleration, deceleration, and stopping.  
  - Adaptive responses to traffic signals to maintain safe vehicle interactions.  

3. **Signal Control:**  
  - Implementation of both fixed and adaptive traffic signal algorithms based on traffic density to optimize flow and minimize congestion.
